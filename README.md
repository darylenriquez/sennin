A translation AID Sample App

This is a sample app that translates from and to 3 Languages: Japanese, English and Tagalog. It can accept voice or text and outputs in both text and speech.

This is just a playground app.

## Setting Up

### Installing Dependencies

run `npm install`

### Providing a Key file

Add a file `config/key.yml` that contains your key from Yandex.com

### Running the App

To run the app just run `npm start`

## Future

 - Probably, I will try to develop the logic behind requesting translation. 
 - Also, maybe I will add voice commands in the future
 - Most Importantly, probably add tests

## Technicalities

The App is an electron JS app.
